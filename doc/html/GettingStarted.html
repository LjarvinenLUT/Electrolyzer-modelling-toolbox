%% Getting Started with Electrolyzer Modelling Toolbox
%% Description
% This toolbox is aimed as a MATLAB tool for electrolysis modelling, for both 
% PEM and alkaline systems. Main functionality is in parametrization of the UI 
% curve based on measured data and usage of the parametrizised curve. This toolbox 
% aims to simplify the process of curve fitting and provide easy-to-use commands 
% for quickly determining the UI curve parameter values and their margins of uncertainty.
% 
% The tool has a collection of models related to different potential and overpotential 
% terms in the water electrolyzer UI curve. The user can also introduce their 
% own models and use them with the tool using simple-to-use functions.
%% System Requirements
% MATLAB version used to create the toolbox: 2021a
% 
% MATLAB toolboxes required for the usage of Electrolyzer Modelling Toolbox:
%% 
% * <https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2021a/gads/index.html Global Optimization 
% Toolbox>
% * <https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2021a/optim/index.html Optimization

% Math Toolbox>
%% Installation
% There are at least three options for preparing this toolbox ready for usage 
% in any Matlab project:
%% 
% # If you have the |electrolyzerModellingToolbox.mltbx| file and posess the 
% admin rights for installation, double click on the |.mltbx| file to initiate 
% installation.
% # If you are allowed to modify the MATLAB search path defined in |pathdef.m| 
% but do not have the |.mltbx| file for direct installation of the toolbox, open 
% the directory of the toolbox in matlab. Run the script |installEModel.m| from 
% that directory to add all the necessary folders to the search path and save 
% it in |pathdef.m|.
% # If you are not allowed to modify permanently the MATLAB search path, copy 
% the script |startup.m| from the toolbox to any project you want to use it. Replace 
% the value of the variable |toolpath| in |startup.m| to include the full path 
% to the Electrolyzer Modelling Toolbox. When MATLAB is opened in the project 
% directory, the |startup.m| script is run automatically. Alternatively, if the 
% project directory is switched from another on while MATLAB is running, you can 
% manually run |startup.m|.

%% Main Features
% class: electrolyzerModel
% Electrolyzer Modelling Toolbox is used through instances of class <matlab:doc('electrolyzerModel') 
% electrolyzerModel>. The object stores basic information about the model, the 
% electrolyzer type, used electrolyte and the potential function describing the 
% UI curve as well as all the measured variables, necessary constants and coefficients 
% obtained from the parametrization. The class contains methods for: 
%% 
% * Defining and modifying the potential function, variables and coefficients. 
% * Performing parametrization through UI curve fitting.
% * Calculating voltage values based on the UI curve parameters, even with variables 
% like temperature or pressure changed from the ones used for parametrization.
% * Displaying model properties and parametrization results and extracting them 
% for use in user-made scripts and functions.
% * Converting alkali electrolyzer electrolyte concentration between mass fractions 
% and molality.
% class: func
% The modelling function as well as any variables, constants and coefficients 
% used for the model are contained in instances of a special class <matlab:doc('func') 
% func>. The class enables simple combination of function handles which are used 
% for describing separate potential terms in the UI curve, and parametrization 
% of the model through curve fitting. The operation of the class is based on function 
% handles that have only one input, a Workspace structure, which in turn contains 
% substructures:
%% 
% * Variables for measured variables, like temperature and pressure that are 
% needed for the model.
% * Constants related to the system, like Faraday's constant or universal gas 
% constant.
% * Coefficients that are obtained from the parametrization of the function 
% handle, like electric resistance or limiting current density.
% * Dependencies between any two variables. Dependencies store the commands 
% used for determining dependent variables that are related to other, independent 
% variables through some external functions. Dependencies are called when the 
% independent variables have been modified, to refresh the dependent variables 
% at the same time. 
%% 
% The func class contains methods for:
%% 
% * Defining and modifying the potential function, variables and coefficients.
% * Modifying the function handle to a form with separate input variables instead 
% of a single structure. The modification enables use of the function handle with 
% MATLAB fitting and optimization tools.
% * Calculating the function output based on given parameters and the ones already 
% stored in the Workspace structure.
% * Adding two separate func objects together combining their function handles 
% through addition and their full Workspaces.
% function: fitUI
% The parametrization of the model is done with a function <matlab:doc('fitUI') 
% fitUI>. The function uses given func object, and voltage and current vectors 
% to perform a curve fit with a user-specified method. The available methods are:
%% 
% * *PS* standing for particleswarm optimization and
% * *NLLSE* for non linear least squares error regression.
%% 
% In addition, the function enables the user to add weight on either low or 
% high current values, or both of them, improving the fitting performance with 
% activation and mass transfer phenomena in the data. Both the parametrization 
% methods provide also error estimates for the fit parameters.
%% Examples
% For an step-by-step usage example of the Electrolyzer Modelling Toolbox, please 
% refer to <matlab:open('./html/usageExample.html') this file>.
% 
% For an example of how to create a custom func object, please refer to <matlab:open('./html/funcCreationExample.html') 
% this file>.
